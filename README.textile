h1. Tracking Trends with Hadoop & Hive on EC2

This repository contains the full source code for "Trendingtopics.org":http://www.trendingtopics.org, built by "Data Wrangling":http://www,datawrangling.com to demonstrate how Hadoop & EC2 can power a data driven website. The trend statistics and time series data that run the site are updated periodically by launching a temporary EC2 cluster running the "Cloudera Hadoop Distribution":http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop-ec2. Our initial seed data consists of the raw wikipedia database content dump along with hourly "traffic logs":http://stats.grok.se/ for all articles collected from the wikipedia squid proxy (curated by Domas Mituzas). We made the first 7 months of this hourly data for all articles available as an Amazon Public Dataset.

The current trend calculations are run with Hadoop Streaming and Hive.  The output produced by these Hadoop jobs is loaded into MySQL and indexed to power the live site. The demo data included with the Rails app on Github was generated from a sample of 100 trending articles on June 6th 2009. A much larger snapshot is available on Amazon Public Datasets (snap-753dfc1c). The Rails app and MySQL database are deployed on Amazon EC2 using Paul Downman’s "EC2onRails":http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/.

h3. Application Features

* Ranked list of the most significant trends over the last 30 days along with total pageviews
* Ranked list of "Rising" articles trending in the last 24 hours
* Daily time series charts and "sparklines":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline for over 2.5 Million wikipedia articles
* Autocomplete functionality and search results ranked by article trend score

h3. How Hadoop is Used in the Application

* Cleaning raw log data and joining title strings with wikipedia page ids
* Aggregating hourly time series data for daily pageview charts and sparklines 
* Generating Statistics that power search autocomplete and the ranking of search results
* Running periodic trend estimation jobs / regressions

The rest of this document will walk through the code which powers the site and describe some basic approaches for extracting trends from log data with Hadoop and Hive.  The individual steps are run manually for the code walkthrough, but would but likely be automated with some combination of Rake, Cron, Puppet, or Chef in a real production environment.

h3. Prerequisites

* "Get an Amazon EC2 Account":http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/
* Complete the "Amazon EC2 Getting Started Guide":http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/
* Download "Cloudera EC2 Hadoop scripts":http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop-ec2
* Clone the "trendingtopics code on github":http://github.com/datawrangling/trendingtopics/tree/master

h2. Raw Data: Hourly Wikipedia Article Traffic Logs

The "Wikipedia Traffic Statistics":http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=2596 Amazon Public Dataset we will process covers a 7 month period from October, 01 2008 to April, 30 2009. This data is regularly logged from the wikipedia squid proxy by Domas Mituzas and was compiled by Data Wrangling for this demo.

h3. Log file format

Each log file is named with the date and time of collection: <code>pagecounts-20090430-230000.gz</code>. The individual hourly files are around 55 MB when compressed, so 8 months of compressed data takes up about 300 GB of space.

Each line has 4 fields: <code>projectcode, pagename, pageviews, bytes</code>

<pre>
      $ grep '^en Barack' pagecounts-20090521-100001 
      en Barack 8 1240112
      en Barack%20Obama 1 1167
      en Barack_H._Obama 1 142802
      en Barack_H_Obama 3 428946
      en Barack_H_Obama_Jr. 2 285780
      en Barack_Hussein_Obama,_Junior 2 285606
      en Barack_O%27Bama 1 142796
      en Barack_Obama 701 139248439
      en Barack_Obama%27s_first_100_days 2 143181
      en Barack_Obama,_Jr 2 285755
</pre>

Many of the raw wiki log page titles are percent-encoded. To match these with the page titles in the wikipedia database, you can transform them as follows in Python:

<pre>
      $ python
     >>> import urllib
     >>> escaped_title = '%22Klondike_Kate%22_Rockwell'
     >>> print urllib.unquote_plus(escaped_title)
     "Klondike_Kate"_Rockwell
</pre>


h3. Handling Wikipedia Redirects

To further complicate the raw data processing, many page titles are actually wikipedia redirects which do not match to the primary key of the wikipedia "Pages" table.  The non-redirect articles are referred to as belonging to "namespace-0".  As part of our Hadoop pre-processing, we can perform a join against a redirect lookup table to find the true wikipedia pageid for a given article title.

<pre>
   mysql> select * from page_lookups where page_id = 534366;
   +---------+------------------------------------------------+--------------+---------+-------------+
   | id      | redirect_title                                 | true_title   | page_id | page_latest |
   +---------+------------------------------------------------+--------------+---------+-------------+
   |  219291 | Barack_Obama                                   | Barack Obama |  534366 |   276223690 | 
   | 3151538 | Barak_Obama                                    | Barack Obama |  534366 |   276223690 | 
   | 3151543 | 44th_President_of_the_United_States            | Barack Obama |  534366 |   276223690 | 
   | 3151544 | Barach_Obama                                   | Barack Obama |  534366 |   276223690 | 
   | 3151545 | Senator_Barack_Obama                           | Barack Obama |  534366 |   276223690 | 
      ....                                                                                   ....

   | 3151644 | Rocco_Bama                                     | Barack Obama |  534366 |   276223690 | 
   | 3151645 | Barack_Obama's                                 | Barack Obama |  534366 |   276223690 | 
   | 3151646 | B._Obama                                       | Barack Obama |  534366 |   276223690 |

h2. Using Hadoop & Hive on EC2 to Spot Trends in Time Series Data

Processing large log datasets like this is a typical use case for Hadoop.  By using MapReduce and EC2 we can run millions of regressions on a distributed cluster to quickly answer analytical questions or generate real time analytics on metrics of interest.

h3. Task 1: Generate Daily Timelines from 1TB of Historical Hourly Logs

Our first task is to calculate daily page views for all 2.5 million English Wikipedia articles, so we can display dynamic Google finance style timelines on the site.

!http://trendingtopics.s3.amazonaws.com/images/american_idol_daily_pageviews.png!

h4. Mounting the Public Dataset Volume

First, we need to access the Amazon public dataset.  From your local machine, launch a small EC2 Ubuntu instance:  

<pre>
	skom:~ pskomoroch$ ec2-run-instances ami-5394733a -k gsg-keypair -z us-east-1a
</pre>

Once it is running and you have the instance id, create and attach an EBS Volume using the Wikipedia Traffic Statistics "public snapshot":http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=2596 (make sure the volume is created in the same availability zone as the ec2 instance)

<pre>
	skom:~ pskomoroch$ ec2-create-volume --snapshot snap-753dfc1c -z us-east-1a
	skom:~ pskomoroch$ ec2-attach-volume vol-ec06ea85 -i i-df396cb6 -d /dev/sdf
</pre>

Next, ssh into the instance and mount the volume

<pre>
	skom:~ pskomoroch$ ssh root@ec2-12-xx-xx-xx.z-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com
	root@domU-12-xx-xx-xx-75-81:/mnt# mkdir /mnt/wikidata
	root@domU-12-xx-xx-xx-75-81:/mnt# mount /dev/sdf /mnt/wikidata
</pre>	
	
h4. Uploading the Data to S3	
	
Hadoop can use Amazon S3 as a distributed file system out of the box, so it will be easier for later EC2 jobs if we store a full copy of the EBS data on S3.  You could eliminate the need for this step by using the Beta of "Cloudera Hadoop with EBS Integration":http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop-ec2-ebs-beta (persistent temporary clusters on AWS).  We will copy the raw pagecount data up to S3 from the EBS volume using S3cmd.  This install and configuration can be automated later on, but for now you will need your AWS access keys handy for the configuration.

<pre>
	root@domU-12-xx-xx-xx-75-81:/mnt# apt-get update
	root@domU-12-xx-xx-xx-75-81:/mnt# apt-get install -y s3cmd
	root@domU-12-xx-xx-xx-75-81:/mnt# s3cmd --configure
</pre>

Set an environment variable MYBUCKET to a bucket you own on Amazon S3
<pre>
	root@domU-12-xx-xx-xx-75-81:/mnt# MYBUCKET=mytrendingtopics	
</pre>

You can upload all the files with a single command, or select a subset based on the file name in case an upload fails:

<pre>
	/mnt# time s3cmd put --force wikidata/wikistats/pagecounts/pagecounts-200904* s3://$MYBUCKET/wikistats/
	/mnt# time s3cmd put --force wikidata/wikistats/pagecounts/pagecounts-200903* s3://$MYBUCKET/wikistats/
	/mnt# time s3cmd put --force wikidata/wikistats/pagecounts/pagecounts-200902* s3://$MYBUCKET/wikistats/
	/mnt# time s3cmd put --force wikidata/wikistats/pagecounts/pagecounts-200901* s3://$MYBUCKET/wikistats/
	/mnt# time s3cmd put --force wikidata/wikistats/pagecounts/pagecounts-200812* s3://$MYBUCKET/wikistats/
	/mnt# time s3cmd put --force wikidata/wikistats/pagecounts/pagecounts-200811* s3://$MYBUCKET/wikistats/
	/mnt# time s3cmd put --force wikidata/wikistats/pagecounts/pagecounts-200810* s3://$MYBUCKET/wikistats/	
	....
</pre>	

Each month has approximately 40GB of compressed data and takes around 30 minutes to upload from a small EC2 instance.  Data transfer between EC2 and S3 is free, so it will cost 50 cents for the entire one time upload.

h4. Customize the Cloudera Hadoop Ubuntu launch scripts

One nice feature of the Cloudera Hadoop Distribution for EC2 is that you have full control over the instances for installing non-standard packages or customizing nodes.  

For example, you can add apt-get installs by editing the USER_PACKAGES section in <code>hadoop-ec2-init-remote-cloudera-ubuntu.sh</code>

Here are the packages we added:

<pre>
	# Specify user packages to install here, separated by whitespace (e.g. 'r-base' for R)
	USER_PACKAGES='r-base r-base-core r-base-dev r-base-html r-base-latex r-cran-date python-rpy \
	python-setuptools python-docutils python-support python-distutils-extra python-simplejson git-core s3cmd'	
</pre>	

Since we want to use S3 as an input file system, we also make the following change so Hadoop knows about our AWS keys:

<pre>
	<property>
	 <name>fs.s3n.awsAccessKeyId</name>
	 <value>BBBIBIBBBBBBBBNPSINC</value>
	</property>
	<property>
	 <name>fs.s3n.awsSecretAccessKey</name>
	 <value>BJKBJBJK/NNNNNNNNNNinINNIONIONION</value>
	</property>	
</pre>	

We can also change the default maximums for map and reduce tasks based on the EC2 instance type and the nature of the Hadoop jobs we will be running.  I found the following settings to work well for c1.medium instances on EC2 for the jobs we ran.  This will likely vary based on the nature of your MapReduce code and data.  

<pre>
	MAX_MAP_TASKS=2
	MAX_REDUCE_TASKS=1

	real	22m41.951s
	user	0m1.924s
	sys	0m0.276s


	MAX_MAP_TASKS=4
	MAX_REDUCE_TASKS=2

	real	15m47.388s
	user	0m2.948s
	sys	0m0.324s	
</pre>	

For c1.xlarge instances, we used <code>MAX_MAP_TASKS=8</code> and <code>MAX_REDUCE_TASKS=4</code>.  

h4. Launching a Hadoop Cluster on EC2

For running daily timeline aggregations across 8 months of data, we will start a 10 node c1.xlarge Hadoop cluster

<pre>
	skom:cloudera-for-hadoop-on-ec2-0.3.1 pskomoroch$ bin/hadoop-ec2 launch-cluster my-hadoop-cluster 10
	skom:cloudera-for-hadoop-on-ec2-0.3.1 pskomoroch$ ssh root@ec2-174-129-165-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com
	$ cd /mnt	
</pre>		
	
Once logged into the master node, you need to wait for the file system setup to complete before running the Hadoop & Hive Jobs.  A "hadoop" directory will appear in /mnt on the master node when the cluster is ready.  While you are waiting, configure S3cmd on the master node as we did previously when uploading the raw data to S3:

<pre>
	$ s3cmd --configure
</pre>

As we did earlier, set an environment variable MYBUCKET on the master node to a bucket you own on Amazon S3
<pre>
	root@domU-12-xx-xx-xx-75-81:/mnt# MYBUCKET=mytrendingtopics	
	root@domU-12-xx-xx-xx-75-81:/mnt# MYSERVER=trendingtopics.org
    root@domU-12-xx-xx-xx-75-81:/mnt# MAILTO=pete@datawrangling.com
</pre>

When the file system is ready, fetch the trendingtopics code from github and then kick off the daily timeline job:

<pre>
	$ git clone git://github.com/datawrangling/trendingtopics.git
	$ bash trendingtopics/lib/scripts/run_daily_timelines.sh $MYBUCKET $MYSERVER $MAILTO
</pre>

The bash script <code>run_daily_timelines.sh</code> executes a series of streaming hadoop jobs and Hive queries before emitting tab delimited output files ready for loading to MySQL.  These files are loaded into our Rails app MySQL database on MYSERVER and job start/stop emails are sent to the MAILTO address.  See the article Appendix for details on the configuration of the Rails server, or edit the bash script to omit the database load & email steps.

h4. Python Streaming Jobs 

For the initial log file text normalization and filtering we used a simple "Hadoop Streaming":http://hadoop.apache.org/core/docs/r0.18.3/streaming.html job with Python.  You can plug any language into Hadoop Streaming jobs, but I prefer Python for text munging.  I didn't use it here, but the latest Cloudera Distribution of Hadoop also supports "Dumbo":http://dumbotics.com/2009/05/31/dumbo-on-clouderas-distribution/ for Python Streaming.

A quick look at lib/python_streaming/daily_timelines.py shows the filtering we apply to page urls in the logs

<pre>
	# Exclude pages outside of english wikipedia
	wikistats_regex = re.compile('en (.*) ([0-9].*) ([0-9].*)')

	# Excludes pages outside of namespace 0 (ns0)
	namespace_titles_regex = re.compile('(Media|Special' + 
	'|Talk|User|User_talk|Project|Project_talk|File' +
	'|File_talk|MediaWiki|MediaWiki_talk|Template' +
	'|Template_talk|Help|Help_talk|Category' +
	'|Category_talk|Portal|Wikipedia|Wikipedia_talk)\:(.*)')

	# More exclusions
	first_letter_is_lower_regex = re.compile('([a-z])(.*)')
	image_file_regex = re.compile('(.*).(jpg|gif|png|JPG|GIF|PNG|txt|ico)')

	# Exclude Mediawiki boilerplate
	blacklist = [
	'404_error/',
	'Main_Page',
	'Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol',
	'Favicon.ico',
	'Search'
	]
</pre>

The first Python Streaming job restricts pageviews to a subset of English wikipedia pages, filters out bad records, then sums hourly pageviews keyed by Article-Date. It emits output something like this:

<pre>
	Barack_Obama}20090422  129
	Barack_Obama}20090419  143
	Barack_Obama}20090421  163
	Barack_Obama}20090420  152
</pre>

As a side note, there is a little known Hadoop Streaming trick buried in this Python script.  You will notice that the date is not actually in the raw log data itself, but is part of the filename.  It turns out that Hadoop makes job parameters you would fetch in Java with something like <code>job.get("mapred.input.file")</code> available as environment variables for streaming jobs, with periods replaced with underscores:

<pre>
	filepath = os.environ["map_input_file"] 
	filename = os.path.split(filepath)[-1]
</pre>

Thanks to "Todd Lipcon":http://twitter.com/tlipcon for directing me to that hack.  A second MapReduce pass then maps the records by article name:

<pre>
	Barack_Obama  20090422 129
	Barack_Obama  20090419 143
	Barack_Obama  20090421 163
	Barack_Obama  20090420 152
</pre>

These records are merged at the reducers to generate a daily time series for each article in serialized JSON format (for easy manipulation in R & Python, or quick loading for the Web UI). 

Format:
<pre>
	article\tdates\tpagecounts\ttotal_pageviews
</pre>

Example:
<pre>
	'Barack_Obama\t[20090419,20090420,20090421,20090422]\t[143,152,163,129]\t587'
</pre>

While the daily article pageviews are in hand, we also calculate the most recent "monthly trend" for each article using a simple difference over the last 30 days.  You can easily drop in a more complicated trend detection model here as well

<pre>
def calc_trend(dates, pageviews):
  dts,counts = zip( *sorted( zip (dates,pageviews)))
  trend_2 = sum(counts[-15:])
  trend_1 = sum(counts[-30:-15])
  monthly_trend = trend_2 - trend_1
  date_str = '[%s]' % ','.join(dts)
  pageview_str = '[%s]' % ','.join(map(str,counts))
  return monthly_trend, date_str, pageview_str
</pre>

h4. Hive MapReduce Jobs & HiveQL

Doing Joins in MapReduce can be a bit of a pain, Hive hides a lot of tedious details behind a simple SQL like syntax most developers are familiar with.  Behind the scenes this compiles down to optimized MapReduce code executed by Hive.  Import and export of data is also very natural and will be familar to MySQL users.  

We are only using Hive in this trend batch job for some simple joins and selects, but it has much more powerful features for analytics including partions, bucketing, and random sampling.  

Here is an example from <code>lib/hive/hive_daily_timelines.sql</code> which solves the redirect matching problem we mentioned above:

Create a <code>raw_daily_stats_table</code> and load it with the output of our Python streaming job directy from HDFS.

<pre>
	CREATE TABLE raw_daily_stats_table (
		redirect_title STRING, 
		dates STRING, 
		pageviews STRING,
	 	total_pageviews BIGINT, 
		monthly_trend DOUBLE) 
	ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
	FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' 
	STORED AS TEXTFILE;

	LOAD DATA INPATH 'finaloutput' INTO TABLE raw_daily_stats_table;	
</pre>	

Create a <code>redirect_table</code> for holding the large Wikipedia pageid lookup table we mentioned in the introduction, the file is loaded directly from the local filesystem, but could be pulled from MySQL using Sqoop instead.

<pre>	
	CREATE TABLE redirect_table (
		redirect_title STRING, 
		true_title STRING, 
		page_id BIGINT, 
		page_latest BIGINT) 
	ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
	FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
	STORED AS TEXTFILE;
	
	LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/mnt/page_lookup_nonredirects.txt' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE redirect_table;	
</pre>

Create an output table to hold the result of the join.  This table mirrors the structure of the daily_timelines table in our MySQL database:

<pre>
	CREATE TABLE daily_timelines (
		page_id BIGINT,
		dates STRING, 
		pageviews STRING, 
		total_pageviews BIGINT) 
	ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS
	TERMINATED BY '\t' STORED
	AS TEXTFILE;
</pre>	

Now we can use a familar join syntax to quickly normalize the page titles with the correct Wikipedia page ids:

<pre>
	INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE daily_timelines
	SELECT redirect_table.page_id, 
		raw_daily_stats_table.dates, 
		raw_daily_stats_table.pageviews, 
		raw_daily_stats_table.total_pageviews 
	FROM redirect_table 
	JOIN raw_daily_stats_table ON (redirect_table.redirect_title = raw_daily_stats_table.redirect_title);	
</pre>	

h4. Inspecting the results

You can monitor your job progress from the broswer by using Foxy Proxy to view the Cloudera Hadoop Web UI (see the "Cloudera EC2 documentation":http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop-ec2 for more details). The following command sets up a tunnel for the Web UI.

<pre>
    $ bin/hadoop-ec2 proxy my-hadoop-cluster
    Proxying to host ec2-75-101-238-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com via local port 6666
    Gangia:     http://ec2-75-101-238-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com/ganglia
    JobTracker: http://ec2-75-101-238-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com:50030/
    NameNode:   http://ec2-75-101-238-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com:50070/
</pre>	


When the Hive job completes, we can inspect the results:

<pre>
	hive> SELECT COUNT(1) FROM pages; 
	2823525
	Time taken: 33.199 seconds
</pre>

We can run a few more quick queries to show how similar HiveQL is to SQL.  Here we find article with the most pageviews over this time period had 33M views:

<pre>
	hive> SELECT MAX(total_pageviews) FROM pages;
	33993049
</pre>
	
<pre>	
	hive> SELECT title, total_pageviews from pages SORT BY total_pageviews DESC LIMIT 10;
	Wiki	33993049
	The Beatles	22153442
	Barack Obama	19065629
	YouTube	18935233
	Wikipedia	12867511
	United States	11574288
	Facebook	11428940
	Deaths in 2009	7540889
	Eminem	7303015
	World War II	7134040
	
    Time taken: 45.36 seconds	
</pre>

Not surprisingly, the article was "Wiki".  Overall this list of popular pages doesn't change much over time and provides little insight.  We can look at titles ranked by monthly trend instead:	
	
<pre>	
	hive> SELECT title, monthly_trend from pages SORT BY monthly_trend DESC LIMIT 10;
	David Carradine	1814665.0
	Tiananmen Square protests of 1989	444343.0
	Roger Federer	413170.0
	Bermuda Triangle	354996.0
	Up (2009 film)	333122.0
	Normandy Landings	315228.0
	North Korea	291515.0
	Sacha Baron Cohen	288334.0
	Father's Day	266678.0
	Kristen Stewart	261492.0
	
    Time taken: 43.328 seconds
</pre>

These results seem much more interesting and timely.  This list looked strange to me at first, but apparently these are all really trending news items for the beginning of June.  I guess I need to stop coding once in a while and keep up with the news...

In addition to serving as the ranked list of "Biggest Mover" articles on the main page of the site, these trends are used to power the site search engine and order autocomplete suggestions:

!http://trendingtopics.s3.amazonaws.com/images/trend_autocomplete.png!

Once we are confident in the results of the Hadoop jobs, we can send the results over to the trendingtopics database server:

<pre>
	$ scp /mnt/trendsdb.tar.gz root@www.trendingtopics.org:/mnt/
</pre>

We also send a copy of the full data up to S3 for safe keeping along with the sample data for development use

<pre>
	$ s3cmd put trendsdb.tar.gz s3://$MYBUCKET/archive/`date --date "now -1 day" +"%Y%m%d"`/trendsdb.tar.gz
	$ s3cmd put trendsdb.tar.gz s3://$MYBUCKET/archive/trendsdb.tar.gz
	$ s3cmd put --force /mnt/sample* s3://$MYBUCKET/sampledata/	
</pre>

Jump over to the database server and execute the <code>load_history.sql</code> script against <code>trendingtopics_production</code>.  You will want to automate these logins and use proper authentication for your own app instead of manually loading the production database like this.  

<pre>
	$ ssh root@www.trendingtopics.org 
	$ cd /mnt
	$ tar -xzvf trendsdb.tar.gz
	$ mysql -u root trendingtopics_production < app/current/lib/sql/load_history.sql
</pre>

h3. Task 2: Daily Trend Estimation

After the initial historical timeline aggregation is complete, we can begin daily runs to detect trending articles over the last 24 hours using new hourly log data.  This job still needs to access some historical data to for baseline comparisons or regressions, but it will be much faster than processing the full timeline.

!http://trendingtopics.s3.amazonaws.com/images/monthly_and_daily_trends.png!

To run the daily job, we repeat the initial cluster launch and configuration steps used in the last job using <code>daily_trend.sh</code>:

<pre>
	$ cd /mnt
	$ bash trendingtopics/lib/scripts/run_daily_trends.sh $MYBUCKET
</pre>

The job steps in the bash script are fairly similar to the first historical aggregation and monthly trend estimation, except that we pass the hourly data directly to the trend estimation script, we need to be sure to pass at least 10 days of data by using wildcards on the s3 path.

One trick worth noting in this script is that we use wildcards in the input paths to select a subset of the s3 files.  At this point we have thousands of hourly files sitting in an S3 bucket.  For the large historical aggregation this was fine, but if we only want to load a subset, then being careful with naming conventions can make your life easier. You can also pass multiple input buckets by adding more -input lines to the hadoop command. Note that in operational mode these simple bash scripts would be parameterized by date, and probably replaced entirely with something more robust.

<pre>
	D0=`date --date "now -1 day" +"%Y%m%d"`
	D1=`date --date "now -2 day" +"%Y%m%d"`	
	
	
	hadoop jar /usr/lib/hadoop/contrib/streaming/hadoop-*-streaming.jar \
  	-input s3n://$1/wikistats/pagecounts-$D0* \
      -input s3n://$1/wikistats/pagecounts-$D1* \
	  -output finaltrendoutput \
	  -mapper "daily_trends.py mapper" \
	  -reducer "daily_trends.py reducer 10" \
	  -file '/mnt/trendingtopics/lib/python_streaming/daily_trends.py' \
	  -jobconf mapred.reduce.tasks=40 \
	  -jobconf mapred.job.name=daily_trends
</pre>

We can inspect a sample of the results in Hive before loading them into MySQL:

<pre>
	hive> SELECT redirect_table.redirect_title, 
		raw_daily_trends_table.trend, 
		raw_daily_trends_table.error 
	FROM redirect_table JOIN raw_daily_trends_table 
	ON (redirect_table.redirect_title = raw_daily_trends_table.redirect_title) 
	SORT BY trend DESC LIMIT 10;

</pre>

Next we send copies of the trend file & sample data up to Amazon S3 for development use

<pre>
	s3cmd put /mnt/daily_trends.txt s3://$MYBUCKET/archive/`date --date "now -1 day" +"%Y%m%d"`/daily_trends.txt
	s3cmd put --force /mnt/sample_daily_trends.txt s3://$MYBUCKET/sampledata/sample_daily_trends.txt
	s3cmd put /mnt/daily_trends.txt s3://$MYBUCKET/archive/daily_trends.txt
</pre>

Copy the output file over to the trendingtopics server:

<pre>
	scp /mnt/daily_trends.txt root@www.trendingtopics.org:/mnt/
</pre>

Load the daily trend data into MySQL on the prod server and build the trend indices:

<pre>
	ssh root@www.trendingtopics.org 
	cd /mnt
	mysql -u root trendingtopics_production < app/current/lib/sql/load_trends.sql
</pre>

Shut down the Hadoop cluster

<pre>	
	$ bin/hadoop-ec2 terminate-cluster my-hadoop-cluster
	Terminate all instances? [yes or no]: yes
	INSTANCE	i-2d7b2c44	running	shutting-down

h2. Next Steps with Hadoop and TrendingTopics

* Create a new daily job which pulls in recent log data from S3 into Hive and imports the Rails app MySQL tables with Sqoop. Aggregate and merge the last 24 hour of log data with the daily_timelines table, then estimate and replace the daily and monthly trends before exporting the new tables to MySQL
* Cron / Rake tasks to automate the daily job
* Plug in better trend algorithms
* Explore Paritions/Buckets with Hive for fast analytics queries
* Generate smaller representative sample datasets for R&D with Hive 
* Merge the trends with text content from the raw wikipedia dumps using Hive to get trends for words/phrases/concepts 
* Combine data with wikipedia link graph dataset on the EBS volume, show related articles for each trend
* Find correlated trends and topics, look for predictive value

h2. Appendix: Running the Rails app

h3. Dependencies for local development:

* Ruby (1.8.7)
* Ruby Gems (1.3.1)
* Capistrano (v2.5.5)
* Rails (2.3.2)

h3. Additional dependencies for running on EC2:

* "Amazon EC2 Account":http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ 
* Steps from EC2 "Getting Started Guide":http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/
* "EC2onRails":http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/
* "Cloudera EC2 Hadoop scripts":http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop-ec2
* "1 TB of Wikipedia Article Traffic Logs (Amazon Public Data Set)":http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=2596
* "Trendingtopics code on github":http://github.com/datawrangling/trendingtopics/tree/master

h3. Running locally in development mode

Fetch the trendingtopics source code:

<pre>
	$ git clone git://github.com/datawrangling/trendingtopics.git
</pre>

Navigate to the root of the source code directory and create the needed configuration files from the provided examples:

<pre>
	$ cd trendingtopics
	$ cp config/config.yml.example config/config.yml
	$ cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml	
</pre>

Do the normal rails gem install dance for any missing dependencies.

<pre>
	$ rake gems:install
</pre>

We also used the following plugins (already included in /vendor):

* autocomplete
* annotated-timeline
* gc4r (modified a bit)


Create the database:

<pre>
    $ rake db:create
    $ rake db:migrate
</pre>

Populate the app with demo data from 100 wiki articles:

<pre>
    $ rake db:develop
</pre>

Launch the rails app itself 

<pre>
	$ script/server 
	=> Booting Mongrel
	=> Rails 2.3.2 application starting on http://0.0.0.0:3000
	=> Call with -d to detach
	=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server
</pre>
	
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to access the application


h3. Deploying the Rails app to EC2

Fetch the source code as shown above, then install the ec2onrails gem as described at http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/:

<pre>	$ sudo gem install ec2onrails </pre>
Find AMI id of the latest 32 bit ec2onrails image (in our case this was ami-5394733a):
<pre>	$ cap ec2onrails:ami_ids</pre>

Launch an instance of the latest ec2onrails ami and note the returned instance address from ec2-describe-instances, it will be something like ec2-12-xx-xx-xx.z-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com 

<pre>
	$ ec2-run-instances ami-5394733a -k gsg-keypair
	$ ec2-describe-instances
</pre>

Create the needed configuration files from the provided examples and edit them, filling in your instance address information, keypairs, and other configuration information as indicated in the comments of each file. See the ec2onrails documentation or source code for more details on each setting.  If you want to make changes to the elasticwulf code, be sure to replace the base github repository in deploy.rb and config.yml with your own github location.

<pre>
	$ cp config/deploy.rb.example config/deploy.rb
	$ cp config/s3.yml.example config/s3.yml
	$ cp config/config.yml.example config/config.yml
	$ cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml	
</pre>	

Be sure to substitute in your own AWS key and secret key in both config.yml and s3.yml (You can leave these out and ec2onrails will still work, it just won't back up MySQL or the log files)

<pre>
	aws_secret_access_key: YYVUYVIUBIBI
	aws_access_key_id: BBKBBOUjbkj/BBOUBOBJKBjbjbboubuBUB
</pre>

If you uncomment the the auth filter in the main page controller, also replace the admin user name and password in config.yml:

<pre>
	admin_user: REPLACE_ME
	admin_password: REPLACE_ME
</pre>

Deploy the app to your launched EC2 instance with Capistrano (this wil take several minutes)

<pre>
    $ cap ec2onrails:setup
    $ cap deploy:cold
</pre>

If you have auth enabled, you can use the admin login information you set in config.yml to access the dashboard from a web browser or as web service at the url of the instance you provided in deploy.rb: http://ec2-12-xx-xx-xx.z-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com . You can also ssh into your running EC2 instance as usual with your keypairs to debug any issues.  See the ec2onrails forums for more help debugging deployment issues.

To redeploy the app after making changes to the base trendingtopics code, just do the usual cap deploy:

<pre>
    $ cap deploy
</pre>

To manually restart the apache service or mongrels:

<pre>
    $ cap ec2onrails:server:restart_services
    $ cap deploy:restart
</pre>

No data will be populated in the production deployed app until you run the included Hadoop Jobs.  To test the deployment, you can use Capistrano to run the db:develop task on the EC2 server, just wipe the dev data before loading real production data.

To put the site in "maintenance mode":http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/01/05, we use the standard cap tasks:

<pre>
	$ cap deploy:web:disable
</pre>

To renable the site:

<pre>
	$ cap deploy:web:enable
</pre>

To load daily updates, we do a "periodic swap":http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/rename-table.html of the data tables in MySQL, replacing them entirely with the staging tables which are loaded from Hive dumps:

<pre>
	RENAME TABLE pages TO backup_pages, new_pages TO pages;
	RENAME TABLE daily_timelines TO backup_daily_timelines, new_daily_timelines TO daily_timelines;
	RENAME TABLE daily_trends TO backup_daily_trends, new_daily_trends TO daily_trends;		
</pre>

Before the next daily load, we swap the "backup" tables back to "new", then they will be truncated before the bulk load starts.

<pre>
	RENAME TABLE backup_pages TO new_pages;
	RENAME TABLE backup_daily_timelines TO new_daily_timelines;
	RENAME TABLE backup_daily_trends TO new_daily_trends;
</pre>
